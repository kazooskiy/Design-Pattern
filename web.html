			1.	An explanation of what a design pattern is
		</b></p>
		
		A design pattern is a format where the javascript is organized so it is functional and easy to read.

		<p><b>
			2.	An explanation of each respective pattern in terms of what it is and why it is used.
		</b></p>
		Creational- Singliton: A class where only one instance(copy) can exist, and provide a global point to access. This is used because Singletom reduces the use of global variables in order to prevent name collisions.<br>
		Structural- Facade: It provides an interface to a set of another interface in a subsystem. It makes the subsystem eay to use. Using the Facade Pattern only shows the presentation layer, and hides the business objects and their interactions. It is also used to refactor codes. <br>
		Behavioral- Memento: Provide temporary storage and restoration of an object in Javascript. It is used to take snapshot of an objects state so changes can be altered easily. <br>

		<p><b>
			3.	An explanation of why and how the two patterns that you have selected work together.
		</b></p>
		Creational- Singliton: Singleton is simply instanciate an object, so I did by creating a simple one.
<br>
		Structural- Facade: The purpose of the Facade Pattern to // access multiple subsystems, so I created the if-else loop.<br>
		Behavioral- Memento: I added the factory class "Caretaker". I wanted to demnstrate where the Memento makes the change in the program, so I save the state, messed it up by changing it to "Dog" and "Cat", and then converting it back.<br>
